## What are PFAS? {.smallish}

<br>

::: {.column width="65%"}
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of 10,000+ synthetic compounds commonly used in manufacturing and consumer products.

Some PFAS have also been used in firefighting foams, resulting in contamination at military sites, airports, and fire-training facilities.^[Barzen-Hanson et al. 2017]

-   Similar properties:

    -   persistence
    -   bioaccumulative
    -   water-soluble
    -   potential for toxicity

## What are PFAS? {.smallish}

<br>

-   Consumption of PFAS contaminated drinking water is associated with higher blood levels of PFAS^[Post et al. 2021, Hu et al. 2019, Seals et al. 2011, Vestergren and Cousins 2009]

-   Elevated levels of PFAS has been associated with thyroid disease, cancer, high cholesterol, obesity, effects on immune function, etc.^[ATSDR PFAS Toxicological Profile]

-   Proximity to PFAS contamination sites is associated with detections of PFAS in drinking water^[Zhang et al. 2016, Hu et al. 2016, Blum et al. 2015]

<!-- ## Background {.smaller}

<br>

::: smallishish
::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment, but the **scope of contamination in the US is still broadly unknown**

-   It is estimated that at least 200 million people have PFAS in their drinking water, but drinking water monitoring data are extremely limited and likely underestimate the extent of PFAS contamination ^[Hu et al. 2016, Andrews et al. 2020, Pelch et al. 2022]

Distributive and procedural environmental injustice: ^[Bullard 2008, Wilson 2012, Balazs et al. 2014, Gee et al. 2004, Mohai et al. 2009, Morello-Frosch et al. 2011]

-   Marginalized communities have historically faced a greater cumulative burden of social and environmental stressors

-   Low-income/EJ communities are under-resourced, likely disproportionately impacted due to:

    -   Historic racial discrimination in housing and occupational sectors

    -   Inequitable siting of siting of polluting facilities

    -   Inequitable enforcement of environmental regulations that concentrate point sources of pollution

## Distributive and procedural environmental injustice {.smallish}

-   Marginalized communities have historically faced a greater cumulative burden of social and environmental stressors^[Bullard 2008, Wilson 2012, Balazs et al. 2014]

-   Low-income/EJ communities are under-resourced, likely disproportionately impacted due to:^[Gee et al. 2004, Mohai et al. 2009, Morello-Frosch et al. 2011]

## Summary of findings {.smallish}

<br> 



-   22% of all census tracts in the contiguous U.S. contain a presumptive or known source of PFAS

::: incremental

-   63% of census tracts fall within a 1-mile of a PFAS source

-   Census tracts that face the greatest burden of environmental exposures and social vulnerability:

    -   Have a greater median percent area within 1-mile of a PFAS source (Q4 = 67.3% vs Q1 = 0%)
    -   Are more likely to fall within a 1-mile range of a PFAS source (OR: 7.47, 95% CI: 7.11-7.86)
    
-   This was consistent in both our model assessing combined SV and EB, and the adjusted effects of the SV and EB modules separately


:::


## EB + SES Themes {.smallish}

<br> 

-   We observed a higher median percent area within 1-mile of a PFAS source in the highest quartiles of all EB themes except Built Environment, which could indicate differences in the impact of EB in urban vs rural tracts  

::: incremental

-   We observed higher median percent area within 1-mile of a PFAS source in the highest quartiles of the race/ethnicity theme and the SES theme

    -   Study by the Union of Concerned Scientists similarly reported a higher number of low-income households and people of color living within 5 miles of a PFAS source^[Desikan 2019]
    
    -   Liddie et al.^[Liddie et al. 2023 (forthcoming)] found that communities with higher % of Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic Black residents had a higher likelihood of sharing a watershed with a PFAS source and a higher likelihood of being served by a PWS with detectable PFAS concentrations

## Strengths + Limitations {.smallish}

<br> 

::: columns



::: {.column width="45%"}

Limitations

-   Precautionary/presumptive PFAS model^[Salvatore et al. 2022, Zhang et al. 2016, Hu et al. 2016]

-   All potential PFAS point sources weighted equally

    -   Reliable PFAS emissions data do not exist


:::



::: {.column width="5%"}
<br>
:::


::: fragment

::: {.column width="50%"}

Strengths

-   We conducted our analysis at the census tract level and observed similar patterns as those reported in other studies

-   Apply a multidimensional index to assess the effect of cumulative social and environmental burdens, both individually and in the aggregate

:::

## Conclusion {.smallish}

<br>

-   Drinking water monitoring is expanding, but will take time 

-   Other studies have identified characteristics of Public Water Systems that make them more vulnerable to PFAS contamination (primary source water type, system size, and technical, financial, and managerial capacity)

-   This study highlights disparities in proximity to sources of PFAS, which may result in drinking water contamination

    -   These disparities should be considered in future PFAS monitoring decisions, in conjunction with other factors that influence system vulnerability

## Urban vs Rural {.smallish}

::: fragment

-   Liddie et al. found an inverse association between both sharing a watershed with a PFAS source and having detectable PFAS and % of residents living below the federal poverty line, with mixed results when stratifying by urban/rural counties

    -   Rural counties with higher % of residents below the federal poverty line were more likely to share a watershed with a PFAS source and have detectable PFAS
        
:::

::: fragment

-   We found that urban census tracts with higher SV had a higher odds of having a PFAS source but did not observe the same association in rural census tracts
        
    -   This difference could be due to varying metrics used to assess poverty and socioeconomic status.
